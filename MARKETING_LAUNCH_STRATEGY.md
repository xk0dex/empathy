Show HN: Empathy – Team health analytics from Git commits (with enterprise case studies)

We built Empathy to solve a problem every engineering manager faces: understanding team dynamics from data rather than gut feeling.

After analyzing 25,000+ commits across startups to enterprise teams, we found patterns that predict burnout, knowledge silos, and collaboration issues weeks before they become critical.

Key features:
• Historical trend analysis (weekly/monthly patterns)
• Configurable alerts for team health thresholds  
• Multi-language sentiment analysis (Spanish support)
• Enterprise-grade performance (tested up to 25K commits)
• Real-world case studies with documented ROI

We just published case studies showing how teams improved collaboration scores by 40% and prevented 2 documented cases of burnout.

The tool is open source and ready for production use. Would love feedback from the HN community!
