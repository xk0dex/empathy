Title: [Open Source] Empathy - Analyze your dev team's health using GitHub data

I built a tool that acts like a "smartwatch for your dev team" - it analyzes GitHub repositories to give insights about team health, collaboration patterns, and potential issues.

**Key features:**
- Sentiment analysis of commits/PRs using NLP
- Knowledge silo detection (who has critical knowledge?)
- Team collaboration metrics
- Interactive web dashboard
- 2-minute setup with demo data

**Use cases:**
- Engineering managers tracking team health objectively
- Scrum masters getting data for retrospectives  
- Team leads detecting burnout early

**Tech stack:** Python, Flask, NLTK/VADER for NLP, Chart.js

The tool includes realistic limitations warnings (NLP isn't perfect, cultural differences, etc.) and focuses on being a support tool rather than making decisions.

Live demo available, completely open source. Feedback welcome!

What do you think? Have you seen similar tools?

### r/ExperiencedDevs

Title: Tool for measuring team health metrics - thoughts on my approach?

Context: I'm a team lead who wanted objective data about team dynamics rather than relying only on subjective observations.

Built "Empathy" - analyzes GitHub repos to generate team health insights:

- Sentiment trends in communication (commits/PR comments)
- Knowledge distribution (detecting silos)
- Collaboration patterns (review participation)
- Overall team health score

**My approach:**
✅ Explicit limitations documentation (NLP isn't perfect)
✅ Support tool, not decision maker
✅ Focus on trends vs absolute values
✅ Privacy-aware (local analysis)

**Questions for experienced devs:**
1. What team health metrics do you actually find useful?
2. Any concerns about analyzing team communication patterns?
3. Have you used similar tools? What worked/didn't work?

Been using it with my team for 2 months - caught some communication issues early and helped with retrospective discussions.

Demo available: https://github.com/xk0dex/empathy

Would love your perspective on the approach!
